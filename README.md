DAPPERWARE is a virtual assistant that prioritizes user productivity and rewards them for staying on task. It's an ongoing project that I plan to expand with more features as time goes on. I know how hard it can be to stay on task, especially when work becomes a slog, which is why I wanted to create a fun buddy that acts as a way to keep the user enticed to push on with their work! This is an assistant designed to not pry into the user's tasks and only acts as a means of help and reward whenever needed. This program utilizes various forms of visual feedback and rewards, such as a fully animated assistant, functional UI, functional productivity apps bult in, such as sticky notes, reminders, to do list, calendar, among other things.

One key feature of this application is its ability to keep track of applications the user deems as part of their workflow, such as word processing applications, web browsers, etc. and reward them for staying on task by giving them XP. The more they stay on task, the more XP they get, and the more they level up, allowing them to earn rewards like desktop decorations and additional features from the shop. This helps keep working exciting and fun.

HOW TO RUN:
This project utilizes key Windows features, such as TTS and general Sys capabilities and thus must be ran on a Windows system. 
Download all files from the repository. The 'files' folder must be placed in a location that the main.cpp file can access without specific locations needed for tasks like reading/writing to files and loading assets. This will depend on the IDE you're using
Load the main.cpp file in an IDE of your choosing that supports C++.
This program uses many C++ libraries. You MUST install the SFML library, as it handles all graphics that are displayed on screen.
Run the program
